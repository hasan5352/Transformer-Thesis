# Transformer-Thesis
This repo contains the code for my Bachelor thesis focused on building Transformer models from scratch for two tasks:
- Sentiment Analysis using a custom Transformer Encoder (based on the original Attention Is All You Need paper).
- Image Classification using a Vision Transformer (ViT) implemented from scratch (based on the original An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale paper).
